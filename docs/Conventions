Make a big dictionary called image_info. Every image is refered as image_info is also a dictionary. This dictionary has another dictionary called save_info. That's the stuff that will be saved. Whenever image_browser opens a new file, it will create image_info, fill it up with all the relevant information, including save_info and emit it. Whoever pleases will connect that signal to their own slot, get any information that they need. Save any information that they like it save_info. Whenevery a new image_info is about to be emitted, image_browser will save the data in the current image_info and then load it up in the new image_info. I think that makes sense for now.
